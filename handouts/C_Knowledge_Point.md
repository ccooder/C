    * 2.1 *Variable Names*
        1. At least te first 31 characters of an internal name are significant.
        For function names and exteranl variables,the number may be less than 31,
        because external names may be used by assemblers and loaders over which
        the language has no control.For example names,the standard guarantees
        uniqueness only for 6 characters and a signle case.
